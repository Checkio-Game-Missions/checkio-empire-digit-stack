**How it is used:**

Stacks have numerous applications. We see stacks in everyday life, from the books in our library,
to the blank sheets of paper in our printer tray. All of them follow the Last In First Out (LIFO) logic,
that is when we add a book to a pile of books, we add it to the top of the pile, whereas when we remove a book from
the pile, we generally remove it from the top of the pile. After all, taking one from the middle just makes a mess.
