In computer science, a stack is a particular kind of data type or collection in which the principal operations in
the collection are the addition of an entity to the collection (also known as push) and the removal of an entity
(also known as pop). The relation between the push and pop operations is such that the stack is a Last-In-First-Out
(LIFO) data structure. In a LIFO data structure, the last element added to the structure must be the first one to be
removed. Often a peek, or top operation is also implemented, returning the value of the top element without removing
it.

Queues alone are not enough to improve our robots functionality, so we will expand their training with stacks.
